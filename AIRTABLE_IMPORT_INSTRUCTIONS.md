# üìö Airtable Import Instructions: PM Book Recommender

## Overview
This guide will help you set up your Airtable base to receive high-quality product management books from the `quality_book_scraper.py` script. The schema is designed to work with fresh, curated data from trusted sources like Lenny's podcast, Ken Norton's blog, and Y Combinator.

## üéØ Purpose
The goal is to build a high-quality, schema-aligned book dataset for your PM Book Recommender app using fresh inputs only.

- **Solution**: Create the missing field in Airtable first

**Issue**: Multiple select fields not importing correctly
- **Solution**: Ensure the values match exactly with Airtable options (case-sensitive)

**Issue**: URLs not working
- **Solution**: Check that the URL field type is set to "URL" in Airtable

**Issue**: Validation errors from quality_book_scraper.py
- **Solution**: Check the script's validation rules and fix data format

**Issue**: Duplicate books
- **Solution**: Use Airtable's duplicate detection or manually review

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify your Airtable field types match the specifications
3. Run the quality_book_scraper.py validation
4. Test with a small dataset first

## üì∏ TODO: Add Book Cover Images

Cover images are currently not included in the database due to unstable external image hosting (Amazon and Goodreads block hotlinking).

### Manual Approach

To populate the `cover_image` field reliably:

1. After the book list is finalized, download cover images manually or with a script using Amazon or Goodreads links.
2. Save each image with a consistent filename, like `inspired.jpg` or a slugified version of the book title.
3. Upload all images to a stable hosting provider (e.g., Cloudinary, Imgur, or S3).
4. Construct the full URL for each image (e.g., `https://res.cloudinary.com/yourname/image/upload/v1/inspired.jpg`).
5. Update the `cover_image` field in Airtable by matching filenames to book titles. This can be automated using a script or done via CSV import.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Alternative (Preferred) Approach: Automate Cover Images via Google Books API

To avoid manual image uploads and unreliable external URLs, you can automate population of the `cover_image` field using the Google Books API.

#### ‚úÖ Steps:

1. Ensure each book record includes an `isbn_13` field.
2. Use the following API query:
   https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:<isbn_13>
3. From the response, extract:
   - `volumeInfo.imageLinks.thumbnail` ‚Üí store in `cover_image`
4. These URLs are stable, public, and suitable for Airtable or app usage.

> If ISBN is not available, fallback search using title + author is possible, but may introduce noise.

#### üöÄ Post-MVP Enhancement

This same enrichment process can be extended to populate:
- `isbn_13` (if missing)
- `averageRating` and `ratingsCount`
- Fallback `summary` from `description`

This creates a robust, scalable enrichment pipeline with minimal manual effort.

Note: This step is optional and can be deferred until final review or post-MVP.
